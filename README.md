# bachelorthesis

In this repository, all code used for analysis in my bachelorthesis on predicting student grades and evaluation from a first year statistics course can be found. In the general analysis file, the analysis on course evaluations is done for all studies combined. In the SOC (sociology), CA (cultural anthropology) and ISW (interdisciplinary social sciences) analysis files, the study specific analysis for course evaluations can be found. In the TOE analysis file, the analysis for predicting student grades can be found.
